/// Please read RM0383 chapter 3 before using this class. Depending on the model of your chip, the frequency at which
/// it is running, and the supply voltage, configuration may require adjustment.
///
/// Different models of STM32 MCUs use different memory management techniques. Some define a collection of pages, each
/// page being uniform in size, while others use non-uniformly sized sectors. These different schemes are handled
/// differently in code, so there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach that will work universally. Currently this class
/// only supports MCUs that use sectors, and it has only been tested with the STM32F411, which has 512kB of FLASH,
/// organized into 8 sectors.
