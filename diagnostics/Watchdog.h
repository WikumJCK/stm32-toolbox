/// <summary>
/// Implements independent hardware watchdog (IHWD) abstraction.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The independent hardware watchdog is used to reset your microcontroller when the code that it is executing fails
/// to respond normally. This class provides a simple interface to implement this workflow, particularly on RTOS
/// designs with multiple tasks.
///
/// In order to implement the watchdog, first define a bitfielded set of up to 32 things that must occur in order to
/// deem the firmware as correctly operational, typically one per execution loop. For example an application with a
/// an LED task and a fan task, we would define:
/// <code>
/// #define LedTaskHealthy 0x01
/// #define FanTaskHealthy 0x02
/// </code>
/// The watchdog will reset the MCU if both of these (LedTaskHealthy|FanTaskHealthy) do not check in within the
/// specified grace period.
/// </remarks>
